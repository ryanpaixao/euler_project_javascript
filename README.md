[mult_3and5.js](https://github.com/ryanpaixao/javascript/blob/rawjs/mult_3and5.js) is the solution to:

  "If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."
  
  
  
[fibonacci.js](https://github.com/ryanpaixao/javascript/blob/rawjs/fibonacci.js) is the solution to:
  
  "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."



[largest_prime.js](https://github.com/ryanpaixao/javascript/blob/rawjs/largest_prime.js) is the solution to:

  "Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor... just solve for numbers smaller than 1,000 and don't worry about making it efficient. You won't need to do 
  any crazy math -- think iteration and make the computer do the work. Consider it extra credit to make your solution solve for larger numbers 
  in a way that isn't too slow."
  
  
  
[largest_prime_ln.js](https://github.com/ryanpaixao/javascript/blob/rawjs/largest_prime_ln.js) is the solution to:
  
  "The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?"
  *Note:* Using largest_prime.js on numbers larger than 100 million will cause the browser to become unresponsive. That's
  why I created largest_prime_ln.js. It looks for prime factors that are larger than 1000 and smaller than quotient of
  the input number and 1000.
